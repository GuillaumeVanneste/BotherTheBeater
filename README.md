# BotherTheBeater

An HETIC Project using NodeJs wwith express, socket.io and body-parser for a musical experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First you will need to go on the [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) website to download and install node

### Installing

Install all dependencies with the npm command.

```
npm install express socket.io body-parser
```

## Deployment

Now, everything you need to do is to create a room by seting a username, a room name and a difficulty.

Each room you create will be displayed in the browser in the home page, and you can quickly join one of these rooms thanks to a join button. 

When 2 clients are in a room, the game will be automaticly be launched and now you can have fun by playing some songs with a friend.

When you arrive at the middle of the song, the Beater becomes the Bother and the Bother becomes the Beater.

At the end you have all your stats and can restart a new game.
